README: Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This Sentiment Analysis project focuses on classifying the sentiment of text data into categories: positive, negative, or neutral. Using advanced machine learning models, it automates the analysis of large volumes of text, providing valuable insights into customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of text-based communication.

Problem Statement
With the growing amount of user-generated content on platforms like social media and review sites, understanding customer sentiments is crucial for businesses to improve services. This project aims to provide a solution for automatically classifying sentiments from text, allowing businesses to understand customer opinions and make data-driven decisions.

Project Structure
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: Used for classification of sentiments.
Decision Tree: Classifies sentiment by splitting data into smaller decision-making units.
Random Forest: An ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
Text Preprocessing:
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical vectors for the models to process.
Real-time Prediction:
Built a Streamlit app for users to input text and receive real-time sentiment predictions.
Deployment:
Deployed the app to be accessible online, allowing users to test predictions with ease.
Key Features
Multiple machine learning models to compare performance.
Real-time sentiment classification into positive, negative, or neutral.
An intuitive interface for easy interaction with the system.
Challenges Faced
Class Imbalance: Addressed using SMOTE to balance the dataset.
Accuracy Improvement: Tuned models for optimal performance.
User Interface: Collaborated with Shreehari to design and implement a user-friendly interface.
Future Improvements
Incorporate deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Real-time sentiment analysis with live streaming data.
Expand model to handle more complex sentiment classifications.
Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Shreehari for contributing as a teammate in designing the user interface and integrating it with the backend models, ensuring a seamless user experience.
