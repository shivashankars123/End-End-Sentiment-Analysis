SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
Problem Overview
Sentiment analysis is an essential natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to classify text into sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. With the growing volume of social media posts, product reviews, and online feedback, understanding sentiment helps businesses and researchers gain actionable insights. This project addresses the challenge of automatically classifying sentiments, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets without manual effort.

Solution Provided
This project applies machine learning techniques for sentiment classification with the following key components:

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: Adapted for multi-class sentiment analysis.
Decision Tree: Splits data based on feature values for predictions.
Random Forest: An ensemble method for improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.
Gradient Boosting: Combines weak models to build a strong classifier.
Text Preprocessing:
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts input text into numerical vectors, capturing word importance for model training.
Real-time Prediction:
A Streamlit app allows users to input text and instantly receive sentiment predictions via an interactive UI.
Demonstration:
Includes a GIF to visually showcase the app's functionality and ease of use.
Key Features
Multi-model support for comparative performance analysis.
An intuitive and interactive interface for testing with real-world inputs.
Real-time sentiment classification into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Impact and Use Cases
This project offers significant benefits in:

Customer Feedback Analysis: Gauge satisfaction by classifying reviews.
Social Media Monitoring: Analyze public sentiment around brands or events.
Market Research: Extract insights from discussions to understand consumer behavior.
By automating sentiment analysis, this project saves time and resources, empowering businesses and researchers to process vast amounts of textual data efficiently.
